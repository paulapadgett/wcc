        <p>The discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman opened up a new era in human history.  It seems to me that what makes science behind this discovery so remarkable is that it was achieved by purely chemical means. ~ Lise Meitner</p>

<h1>
    Brief Life History
</h1>
    <p>
        Lise Meitner was born on November 7th, 1878, to Jewish parents in Vienna.  She started experimenting with science at age 8.  Even though girls were not allowed to attend public institutions, Lise received an excellent private education.  During WWI she worked as a nurse handling x-rays.  In 1926, she became the first woman in Germany to become a full professor at the University of Berlin.  She worked closely with Otto Hahn to discover nuclear fission.  During WWII she left Germany and lived in Sweden until after the war.  In 1960 she moved to England, where she later died in 1968.
